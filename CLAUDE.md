# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Status

Research preview. The kernel, bridge, MCP protocol (exec / get_task / cancel), human gates, channel infrastructure, and scaffolding commands are live. When implementing, treat `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as the design spec (architecture, status checklist, design principles) and this file for subsystem details and invariants. README.md is user-facing only. Don't drift from the shape described here without discussion.

## Build & run

Python 3.12+, managed with **uv** using the `uv_build` backend (see `pyproject.toml`).

```bash
uv sync                                 # install deps into .venv
uv run repld                            # runs the `repld:main` entrypoint
uv build                                # wheel + sdist via uv_build
uv run tests/smoketest.py --phase 9           # end-to-end smoketest
ruff check --fix && ruff format && basedpyright   # lint / format / type-check
```

No CI configured yet. If you add any, update this file.

## Testing

`tests/smoketest.py` is the entire test suite — no pytest setup. It starts a real kernel + bridge subprocess and drives MCP JSON-RPC over stdio. `--phase N` runs phases 1..N (default 3, current ceiling 12). When you add a feature, extend a phase rather than introducing a separate harness.

Phases:
- **2–3:** Core MCP plumbing — initialize, tools/list, sync exec, deferred exec, get_task polling.
- **4:** Channel notifications — task_done push, notify() from user code, pre-gate queuing.
- **5:** Lockfile conflict detection, `--init` file execution.
- **6:** Tool registration, gist auto-reload, browser integration (requires Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`).
- **7:** `defer()` — fire-and-forget with channel push on completion.
- **8:** Gist resources — `resources/list` includes one entry per loaded gist (with first-docstring-line as description); `resources/read repld://gists/{name}` returns the introspected API.
- **9:** Gist-registered MCP tools — `__repld_tools__` discovery, dispatch, auto-reload, error handling.
- **10:** `@every(seconds)` decorator — periodic ticker, immediate first tick, error survival, `cancel()` / `cancel_all()`.
- **11:** Graceful shutdown — `_shutdown` drains `@every` + `defer()` `try/finally` blocks before stopping the loop, with a 2 s budget.
- **12:** Cross-project gist links — `add_link` resolves via the registry + AST sibling co-link, writes `./gists/.links`; a fresh kernel boots with the manifest and the linked gist imports (sibling resolving); stale entries skipped at load + pruned by `rm --stale`.

## Key subsystems

All source lives under `src/repld/`. Individual files are self-describing; what matters is how they connect:

**Request flow:** Claude Code spawns `bridge.py` (stdio MCP) → bridge reads `.pyrepl.lock` → proxies JSON-RPC over unix socket (`ipc.py`) → `protocol.py` dispatches to `exec`, `get_task`, `cancel`, or browser tools → `runtime.py` runs code in `__main__` → results (or `task_id` for deferred work) flow back. Channel notifications (`events.py`) flow kernel → bridge → Claude Code.

**Four-surface doc system (`help.py`):** Agent-facing docs are split across four non-overlapping surfaces. Keep them in sync:
1. **INSTRUCTIONS** (dynamic) — behavioral model composed at MCP init by `build_instructions()`. Includes exec model always; browser model only when `browser` exists in `__main__`; gist signatures extracted via AST from available gists. This is what the agent reasons with. Terse; always loaded.
2. **Tool descriptions** — per-tool what + gotchas, defined in `protocol.py`.
3. **Topics** — pure API reference for `repld help <topic>`, defined as `_TOPICS` in `help.py`.
4. **GUIDE** — MCP resource (`repld://docs/guide`), defined as `GUIDE` in `help.py`. Working guide with execution model, browser API, gist patterns, and conventions. Read on demand by the agent before writing gists. Available from any project running repld.

**Browser (`browser/`):** CDP integration via WebSocket multiplexer. DuckDB event store for network/console queries (HAR-style). Fetch domain interception captures request/response bodies. Observation pipeline (`observe.py`) returns accessibility tree + network delta + console delta after mutations. Pin/gate bridge: `tab.pin(reason)` injects a floating pill via `Runtime.evaluate` + `beforeunload` guard; `tab.confirm()`/`tab.choose()` route human gates to the pill UI; button clicks flow back via `Runtime.bindingCalled` → `resolve_gate()`. Terminal and browser resolve the same Future — first wins. See `docs/browser.md` for full design rationale.

**Gist system (`gists.py`):** Custom import hook (`_GistFinder` + `_GistImportHook`) wraps `builtins.__import__`, tracks mtimes, evicts stale modules from `sys.modules` on re-import. Module docstring first line → auto-injected into MCP instructions. Override with `__repld_help__ = "..."`. Constructor signatures extracted via AST and shown alongside the description. Gists can also register MCP tools via `__repld_tools__` — `scan_tools()` discovers tool schemas across all gist files, `resolve_tool(name)` imports the owning gist and returns its `_tool_{name}` handler. Tools appear in `tools/list` automatically alongside built-in tools. Gists declare external dependencies via `__repld_deps__ = ["httpx>=0.27"]` — `scan_deps()` AST-scans at boot, `install_deps()` prompts interactively and installs into the tool venv via `uv pip install`. Every import is recorded in a central registry (`~/.config/repld/gist-registry.json`, name → path/project/last_used). **Cross-project links:** `repld gist add <name>` resolves a registered gist's path, AST-follows its same-dir sibling imports, and records absolute paths in a committed `./gists/.links` manifest — without copying. At boot `_load_links()` populates the `_linked` name→path overlay (consulted by `_GistFinder` + `_iter_gist_files` *after* local dirs, so local gists always shadow); stale entries are skipped (never auto-rewritten — the manifest is committed). `repld gist list` shows local + linked (flagging stale), `repld gist rm <name>` / `rm --stale` unlink.

## Architecture (target shape)

Six CLI subcommands, all dispatched from `repld:main`:

- `repld` — long-running Python kernel in the project cwd. Writes `./.pyrepl.lock` with `{pid, socket_path}`; listens on a unix-domain socket for IPC.
- `repld bridge` — short-lived stdio MCP subprocess spawned by Claude Code via `.mcp.json`. Inherits cwd, reads the lockfile, proxies stdio MCP ↔ the kernel's IPC socket. Also relays channel notifications (`notifications/claude/channel`) back to the client.
- `repld init` — idempotent project scaffold: writes `.mcp.json` (adding a `repld` entry if one isn't present) and appends `.pyrepl.lock` / `.pyrepl.sock` to `.gitignore`.
- `repld help [TOPIC]` — agent-facing docs. Single source of truth shared with the MCP `initialize` `instructions` field (`src/repld/help.py:INSTRUCTIONS`). Never let the two drift.
- `repld exec [CODE]` — human-facing CLI. With no args, interactive REPL over IPC (shared namespace). With a string arg, one-shot execution. Same kernel, same state as the agent.
- `repld gist` — command group: `new <name>` (scaffold `./gists/<name>.py`), `add <name>` (link a registered gist from another project), `rm <name>` / `rm --stale` (unlink), `list` (local + linked + linkable-from-registry). Unknown verbs error (no verb-less scaffold alias). Top-level CLI dispatch is a single `_SUBCOMMANDS` table in `cli.py` driving both dispatch and `--help`.

Key invariants to preserve when building this out:

- **One process, one asyncio loop.** The kernel owns a single shared loop so `asyncio.create_task(...)` from any exec call survives past the exec return and can push to channel on completion.
- **`exec` returns fast or defers.** If user code finishes within `timeout` (default 2s) return inline; otherwise return `{task_id, done: false}` and push a channel notification on completion. Every cell with output spills to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/repld/{pid}-{tid}.out` from byte 1; the inline response carries a head+tail preview and the absolute spill path. Agents use the standard Read/Grep tools on that path — there is no `read_spill` MCP tool.
- **Stdlib only in core.** Zero required runtime dependencies. Optional extras (`repld[pretty]` for rich-rendered display) gate anything heavier. Don't pull new deps into the base package.
- **Per-cwd, localhost-only.** The IPC socket stays on `127.0.0.1` or a user-only unix socket. This is a dev-time tool; never add anything that would make it safe to expose.

## Design principles (from README)

- **Substrate, not library.** Expose small composable primitives (`notify`, `defer`, `@every`, `@watch`, `@webhook`, `browser.get`) and let the LLM write integration code against live pages/APIs/DBs. Resist adding per-service helpers.
- **Channel push over polling.** Long jobs, file watchers, webhooks, and timers all surface as `<channel>` injections rather than requiring the agent to poll.
- **Shared `__main__` namespace.** Human and agent operate on the same module dict — don't sandbox the agent into an isolated scope.
